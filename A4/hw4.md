# Homework 4

## Problem 1

### a)
First of all, Live variable analysis has property of $L$, we have finite many program label $l$ and in the property space we define our $S$ as power set of set of program label, meet operator in property space defined as set union.

Secondly, the transfer function of Live Variable Analysis is defined as $LV_{entry}(l) = LV_{exit}(l) \setminus \text{write}(l) \cup\text{read}(l)$, apparently this is $P(D)\rightarrow P(D)$ and $LV_{exit}(l)\setminus \text{write}(l)$ is equivalent to $LV_{exit}(l)\cap (LV_{exit}(l)\setminus \text{write}(l))$ and clearly $(LV_{exit}(l)\setminus \text{write}(l))\subseteq S$ where $S$ is the power set of all program label, therefore the transfer function of Live Variable Analysis statisfies $F$

### b)
For generality, let the operator $\sqcap$ be $\cap$, since $\cap\text{ and }\cup$ share the same rule of associativity. commutativity, distributivity, which for our prove will provide same result

let $l_a, l_b \in L$

$$\begin{aligned}
f(l_a\sqcap l_b) & = f(l_a \cap l_b)\\
& = (l_a \cap l_b) \cap K \cup G\\
& = ((l_a \cap K)\cap(l_b \cap K)) \cup G\\
& = ((l_a \cap K) \cup G) \cap ((l_b \cap K) \cup G)\\
& = f(l_a) \cap f(l_b)
\end{aligned}$$

This proved distributivity.

### c)

Example: 

$L = (\mathcal{P(D)}, \cap)$

$\mathcal{F} = \{\mathcal{f:P(D) \rightarrow P(D)} | \forall \mathcal{f \in F}, \exists a\notin D \wedge \forall S \in D, \mathcal{f}(S) = S + \{a\}\}$


Faint variable analysis is an another example of  distributive framework but it nont is bit vector framework.

## Problem 2

### a)

partially available expressions:
An expression is partially available at a program point 
$l$, if the expression is available along some path to point 
$l$.

$Gen(l_n)$ = { e | expression e is evaluated in basic block n and this evaluation is not followed by a definition of any operand of e} 

$Kill(l_n)$ = { e | basic block n contains a definition of an operand of e}


### b)

An expression e is anticipable at a program point $l$, if every path from point $l$ to the program exit contains an evaluation of e which is not preceded by a redefinition of any operand of e.

### c)

#### To remove PRE
1. Identify partial redundancies 
2. Identify program points where computations can be inserted 
3. Insert expressions 
4. Partial redundancies become total redundancies =â‡’ Delete them.

#### Placement Possible Analysis

An expression can be safely inserted at a program point p if it is

1. If it is available at p, then there is no need to insert it at p. 
2. If it is anticipable at p then all such occurrence should be inserted to p. 

An expression should be inserted to p provided it can be inserted to p along all paths from p to exit.

* safety of Inserting to the exit of a block. 

	 Should be inserted only if it can be inserted to the entry of all successors. 
* safety of Inserting to the entry of a block.

	 Should be inserted only if it is upwards exposed

	 it can be inserted to its exit and is transparent in the block .
* Desirability of inserting to the entry of a block. 

    Should be inserted only if:
    * it is partially available, 
    * For each predecessor 
        * it is inserted to its exit, 
        * is available at its exit.


Partial availability:

$$PA_{entry}(l_0) = \emptyset$$ 


$$PA_{entry}(l_i) = \bigcup_{l_j \in pred(l_i)} PA_{exit}(l_j)$$ 


$$PA_{exit}(l_i) = Gen(l_i) \cup (PA_{entry}(l_i) \setminus Kill(l_i))$$

Total availability:

$$TA_{entry}(l_0) = \emptyset$$ 

$$TA_{entry}(l_i) = \bigcup_{l_j \in pred(l_j)} TA_{exit}(l_j)$$ 

$$TA_{exit}(l_i) = Gen(l_i) \cup (TA_{entry}(l_i) \setminus Kill(l_i))$$

PRE Data Flow Equation:

$$Entry(l_i) = PA_{entry}(l_i) \cap (AntGen(l_i) \cup (Exit(l_i)\setminus Kill(l_i))) \bigcap_{l_j \in pred(l_i)} (Exit(l_j) \cup (TA_{exit}(l_j)))$$

$$Exit(l_n) = \emptyset$$

$$Exit(l_i) = \bigcap_{l_j \in succ(l_i)} Entry(l_j)$$

### d)

#### insert l:

An expression is inserted at the exit of node $n$ if
* it can be placed at the exit of $n$, AND 
* it is not available at the exit of $n$, AND 
* it cannot be Inserted out of $n$, OR it is modified in $n$.

$Insert(n) = Exit(n) \cap (\neg AvOut(n)) \cap (\neg Inn \cup Kill(n))$

#### delete l:
An expression is redundant in node $n$ if 
* it can be placed at the entry of $n$, AND 
* it is upwards exposed in $ode $n$.
    
$Redundant(n) = Entry(n) \cap AntGen(n)$
